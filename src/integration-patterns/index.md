# Integration Patterns in Salesforce

This document provides an overview of various integration patterns used in Salesforce, detailing their purpose, implementation strategies, and best practices.

## 1. Remote Call-In

### Purpose
The Remote Call-In pattern allows external systems to call Salesforce APIs to perform operations such as creating, updating, or retrieving records.

### Implementation Strategy
- Use REST or SOAP APIs based on the requirements.
- Ensure proper authentication using OAuth 2.0.
- Implement error handling and logging for API calls.

### Best Practices
- Limit the number of API calls to avoid hitting governor limits.
- Use bulk APIs for large data operations.
- Secure sensitive data during transmission.

## 2. Remote Call-Out

### Purpose
This pattern enables Salesforce to make outbound calls to external systems to retrieve or send data.

### Implementation Strategy
- Utilize HTTP callouts in Apex to interact with external services.
- Handle responses and errors appropriately.

### Best Practices
- Use Named Credentials for managing authentication.
- Implement asynchronous processing for long-running callouts.
- Monitor callout limits and optimize requests.

## 3. Batch Processing

### Purpose
Batch Processing is used for handling large volumes of data efficiently by processing records in chunks.

### Implementation Strategy
- Use Batch Apex to define the batch size and processing logic.
- Schedule batch jobs as needed.

### Best Practices
- Optimize batch size based on the operation and governor limits.
- Implement error handling and logging within batch jobs.
- Monitor job status and performance.

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture

### Purpose
This pattern leverages events to trigger actions in Salesforce or external systems, promoting loose coupling.

### Implementation Strategy
- Use Platform Events or Change Data Capture to publish and subscribe to events.
- Implement triggers or external services to respond to events.

### Best Practices
- Design events with a clear schema to ensure compatibility.
- Monitor event delivery and processing for reliability.
- Use replay IDs for event reprocessing if needed.

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing these integration patterns can significantly enhance the effectiveness of Salesforce integrations, ensuring they are robust, scalable, and maintainable.
