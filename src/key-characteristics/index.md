# Key Characteristics of Salesforce Integrations

## Performance Considerations
- **Latency**: Understand the impact of network latency on integration performance and optimize data transfer methods.
- **Throughput**: Evaluate the volume of data being processed and ensure the integration can handle peak loads efficiently.

## Security Aspects
- **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- **Authentication**: Use OAuth or other secure methods for authenticating API calls to ensure only authorized access.

## Scalability Factors
- **Load Balancing**: Design integrations to distribute workloads evenly across resources to handle increased demand.
- **Modular Architecture**: Create integrations that can be easily scaled by adding or modifying components without significant rework.

## Error Handling
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement strategies for retrying failed transactions to enhance reliability.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Compliance
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Ensure integrations comply with relevant regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, particularly when handling personal data.

## Maintainability
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for all integrations to facilitate future updates and troubleshooting.
- **Version Control**: Use version control practices to manage changes and maintain a history of integration modifications.
